									<p>On 2nd November 2023, me and my partner have done lab activity at PMO Lab. Before the lab activity, we are required to make the logic circuit by using Deeds. It was my first time to use Deeds to make logic circuit as during my matriculation I need to draw it manually. Besides, It it is also my first to make the circuit using breadboard. Not to mention that I also get learn a lot of things, for instance, I get to know the exact shape of different gate, get to now a lot of component on ETS which came with different functionality.</p>
                                    <p>It was a great experience for me as a first year student. The circuit may be hard to make it came out as what I predicted as it was my first time. But to be honest, it all thanks to my partner in helping me to understand the flow of the circuit better as it was my maiden experience in making the circuit. <p>
