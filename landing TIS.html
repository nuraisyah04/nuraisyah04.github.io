											<p>On 17th November 2023, our class has went to industrial visit to HUAWEI and PETRONAS. Mr. Roman Kvaska and Mr. Ninderjit Singh has open my eyes in how things 'REALLY WORK' in working life in this industry.

I also get to know that HUAWEI sponsored Ideahub at UTMDigital where UTMDigital used it TM Room for video conference and etc.</p>

											</header>
											<p>On 22th November 2023, I've done this lab activity along with my groupmates. During activity. the lab technician show us step-by-step on how to assemble and reassemble the CPU. Not to mention that we also get to know the name of each part of the internal component and also the do's and don's on each component. The experience to open up the CPU is very fascinating as this is my maiden to open and look into the internal part of computer hardware. Plus, I get to know the function of every component of the internal component of CPU where this experience is very worth it for a computer science students and hope to get to experience more with more complex device.</p>
